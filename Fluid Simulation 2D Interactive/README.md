# Fluid Simulation 2D - Interactive
This is a fluid simulation in 2 dimensions that corresponds to how a fluid behaves according to the Navier-Stokes equations.
This simulation has a source wherever the mouse is when being clicked and the fluid slowly dissipates away to not oversaturate the box of fluid.
