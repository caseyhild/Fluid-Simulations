# Fluid Simulation - Fire
This is a fluid simulation in 2 dimensions that corresponds to how fire, having fluid-like properties, behaves according to the Navier-Stokes equations.
This simulation has a source at the bottom of the screen and the fire slowly dissipates away the higher up it goes as a real flame would.
