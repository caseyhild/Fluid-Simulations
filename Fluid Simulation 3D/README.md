# Fluid Simulation 3D
This is a fluid simulation in 3 dimensions that corresponds to how a fluid behaves according to the Navier-Stokes equations.
This simulation has a source at the upper left corner of the bounding box for the fluid and the fluid slowly dissipates away to not oversaturate this box.
